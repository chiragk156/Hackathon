# Hackathon
Hackathon, Advitiya IIT Ropar
This project was challenge presented to us in Hackathon conducted in Advitiya IIT Ropar.
We had to design a innovative way to control environmental pollution in form of a software.

## Our Approach
-> We decided to make use of Air pollution, Noise Pollution and Water Pollution to make the user aware of the pollution around him through a web app.  
-> For Air Pollution, we make use of Air quality index(standard data) to compute air qulaity in the mentioned city.  
-> For water pollution, we did the same thing except that we made the database ourself for the water quality in few cities. This was made after a bit of research on water degradation level.  
-> For Noise Pollution, we tried to make use of the audio sensors in the PC(or desktop) to render the noise to the system in the real-time.  
    Then we use the standarad Noise levels to check if the sound in the surrounding lies in the Noise level(again standard data used). If the noise level is reached, the user is prompted to take action in the form of an application to Central Pollution Control Borad(CPCB), India.
